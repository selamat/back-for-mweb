# Java Process对象应用

### hadoop中在common包内部封装Shell.java类，用于执行Shell命令，通过Runtime.getRuntime().exec() 或者 ProcessBuilder.start() 启动进程都会返回Process对象，顺手查了一下Process类解释

* If you start the process from with in your Java application (ex. by calling Runtime.exec() or ProcessBuilder.start()) then you have a valid Process reference to it, and you can invoke the destroy() method in Process class to kill that particular process.

* But be aware that if the process that you invoke creates new sub-processes, those may not be terminated (see http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4770092).

* On the other hand, if you want to kill external processes (which you did not spawn from your Java app), then one thing you can do is to call O/S utilities which allow you to do that. For example, you can try a Runtime.exec() on kill command under Unix / Linux and check for return values to ensure that the application was killed or not (0 means success, -1 means error). But that of course will make your application platform dependent.
