# docker 操作

### 1. docker 命令

* remove all stopped containers
	
	```shell
	docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
	```
	
* remove all untagged images
	
	```shell
	docker rmi $(docker images | grep "^<none>" | awk "{print $3}")
	```
	
* export image

	```shell
	docker save -o centos7.tar $image:$tag
	```

* import image
	
	```shell
	docker load --input centos7.tar
	```

* Pass environment to docker container

	```shell
	$ docker run -e ENV=env
	```

	```shell
	$ docker run -v `pwd`=$dirInContainer
	```

* specified port
	
	```shell
	$ docker run -p [([<host_interface>:[host_port]])|(<host_port>):]<container_port>[/udp] <image> <cmd>
	```

* Rm container
	
	Sometimes, you will meet 
	
	```shell
	Error response from daemon: Conflict. The name "registry-v1" is already in use by container f9e5798a82e0. You have to delete (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
	```
	
	That means you have already started a container in the past with the parameter docker run --name registry-v1 ....
	
	You need to delete that first before you can re-create a container with the same name with docker rm registry-v1. When that container is sill running you need to stop it first before you can delete it with docker stop registry-v1. Or simply choose a different name for the new container.
	
	To get a list of existing containers and their names simply invoke docker ps -a.
	
	**docker run** Run a command in a new container

	**docker start** Start one or more stopped containers
